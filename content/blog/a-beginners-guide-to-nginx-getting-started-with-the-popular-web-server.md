Well, we have all heard about Nginx as a web server, reverse proxy, load balancer, and proxy server for email communications, and it is also known for its performance and stability. Let us start with some hands-on with Nginx and see what it can do.

## How to Set Up Nginx

Let's first install nginx by running the below command

```bash
sudo apt install nginx -y
```

Once installed, it should be automatically up and running. You can check the status by running.

```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

If the status is running, then we all are set. If not, then we may have to explicitly start the service by running.

```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

Now, if everything is set, you can visit `localhost`, and you should see an nginx welcome page.

## Getting Started with Web Server Configuration

After installing Nginx, the Linux system stores all the Nginx files in the directory `/etc`. So let's go to `/etc/nginx` and check all the files. In those files, there is one particular file which is very interesting to us, i.e. `nginx.conf`, which has all the instructions for various configurations.

Let's do one thing. Let's take a backup of that file and let's write our own code.
For taking a backup, lets run this

```bash
sudo mv nginx.conf nginx.conf.backup
```

Now, lets have our configuration.

```bash
events {

}
http {
    server {
        listen 80;
        return 200 "Hello from nginx!"
    }
}
```

It's a simple one; we just defined an HTTP server which listens to port 80, and when accessed, it will just return `Hello from nginx!`

Before that, we need to tell Nginx about our new configuration and then restart Nginx. First, let's check for any syntax mistakes by running.

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

If there were no errors, it should say successful at the end. Once that is done, lets now restart our nginx by running

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

`Note:` There are various ways to reload nginx, which we will mention in further blogs.

Now, let's refresh our `localhost` and see the response. Vola. it shows `Hello from nginx!`

### Conclusion

See, a simple Nginx server is relatively easy to set up. Let's learn more about nginx and its configurations in our next blog.
